    <h2>Read this first</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Midwest/East bias:</b> This site's results date back to August 2021 and include more 15s games for teams in the Midwest/East. More games mean more wins by
            the top teams mean higher ratings for those teams. Expect the top west coast teams to rise during spring 2023 play. This seasonal bias will likely be
            negligible in a year's time.
        </li>
        <li><b>Men's D1:</b> This site is focused on Division 1 Men's Collegiate Rugby. Games by Division 1 teams against opponents in other divisions are included.
            Non first side games are not included.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Rating overview</h2>
    <p>
    This site uses an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system' target='_blank'>Elo rating system</a>. Elo was started for chess and has been
    adopted for a variety of sports, including rugby.
    <a href='https://sites.northwestern.edu/msia/2019/01/25/introducing-a-new-rating-system-for-world-rugby-union-based-on-the-elo-rating-system-the-elor-elo-rugby/' target='_blank'>
    This research project</a> explains this site's Elo implementation. Additionally, code for this site is <a href='https://github.com/matttrenary/rugby-ratings' target='_blank'>
    available on GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    The primary features of an Elo system are:
    <ul>
        <li>Teams gain rating points by winning, and lose rating points by losing</li>
        <li>The gained and lost rating points are equal; it's an exchange of points</li>
        <li>Teams gain more when beating higher rated teams, and gain fewer when beating lower rated teams. Vice versa with losing.</li>
        <li>Margin of victory impacts the points gained or lost, but the impact tapers off as the margin increases.</li>
        <li>Home victories earn fewer rating points than away victories. Vice versa with losing.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Cautions in use</h2>
    <p>
    Like any rating system, the more games played, and the greater variety of opponents, the more accurate the system will be. 15s rugby tends to have a relatively
    low number of games, often against a small pool of opponents (the team's conference). The ratings for teams who play in a conference with very few
    out-of-conference games should be used with less confidence than teams with a wider variety of opponents.
