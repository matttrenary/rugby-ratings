    <h2>Rankings Disclaimer</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Men’s Division 1:</b> This website focuses on Division 1 men’s college rugby. Games are only included
          if they are full length (80 minutes for 15s; 14 minutes for 7s) and between two schools' first sides. Games
          played by Division 1 teams against lower-division opponents are still included.
        </li>
        <li><b>Small Samples:</b> The more games played, and the greater variety of opponents, the more accurate the
          algorithm will be. 15s rugby tends to have a low number of games, often against a small pool of opponents
          (each team’s conference). The rankings for teams who play in conferences with very few nonconference games
          should be used with less confidence than those for teams with a wider variety of opponents.
        </li>
        <li><b>Regional Bias:</b> This website’s results only date back to August 2021. Because of scheduling
          differences between regions, Midwest/East teams have played significantly more 15s games, and West/South teams
          have played significantly more 7s games. More games mean more wins by the top teams, which means higher
          ratings for those teams. Expect the top West/South 15s teams and the top Midwest/East 7s teams to rise during
          Spring 2023 play. This seasonal bias should be negligible after another season.
